![uri-vs-url.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638891053272/Etxeeav3qn.png)
URL(Uniform Resource Locator) known as the address of a website is a reference for a resource and a way to access that resource

structure of a URL

protocol://[hostname]path[?query][#fragment]

While 

URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) is a way to identify a resource.
Unlike the URL, the Uniform Resource Identifier doesn't necessarily provide the means to locate the resource

To summarize it, the URL is a subset of a URI, ( that is to say, URL is a URI with a way to access that resource), another example of a URI is an ISBN. ( The International Standard Book Number is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique. )
